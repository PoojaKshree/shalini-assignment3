                                                  DAA ASSIGNMENT - 3
                                                    PROGRAM 12
 TEAM DETAILS
*SHALINI.S-1KS18CS090 
*SUSHMITHA.S-1KS18CS106
*VIJETHA-1KS18CS117

 CONTRIBUTION

*SHALINI.S-Coding for implementation of knapsack using greedy method and submission.
*SUSHMITHA.S-Coding for implementation of knapsack using greedy method and testing.
*VIJETHA-Coding for implementation of knapsack using greedy method and report making.

INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM

*Before compiling the program create the separate file using .txt extension. 
*enter the input in  file as weight of each in first line and profits in second line.
*Now Compile the program.
*Give the input filename as first argument and maximum capacity as second argument.
*Run the program.

DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:

*input for file.
weight=18,15,10
profit=25,24,10
*Enter the capacity =20
output
the result vector is:: 0 1 0
Mximum profit is :: 31.50

CHALLENGES FACED:
*Coding for using file concept, because for the first time we are using this concept and input is 2 arrays .
*Debugging was the challenging because error in opening the file.
*Implementing coding for the knapsack using greedy approach.
*3 members of our team don't have laptops we took help from our classmates t execute program and tell errors, so it took time for us to complete assignment.

 
HOW WE FACE THE CHALLENGES:
*We separate the works and we worked together with many ideas.
*We refer many books and videos regarding this concept.
*We took help of our friends and seniors.
*We tried error and correction method.

WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:

*We learnt concept of using file in program.
*We understood the concept of greedy method.
*We learnt to trace a program in each and every step.
*We learnt the importance of coordination among us.
